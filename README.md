## :zap: Technology

The app is built using React.js and Node.js with AWS technologies for data storage and retrieval. The app also utilizes a GraphQL to connect to the AWS DynamoDB database.

🔹	AWS AppSync - a fully managed service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs by handling the heavy lifting of securely connecting to data sources. It allows developers to build flexible, real-time apps by using GraphQL to securely connect to data sources such as AWS DynamoDB.

🔹	AWS Cognito - a user identity and data synchronization service that helps to securely manage and synchronize app data for users across their mobile devices. It provides features such as user sign-up, sign-in, and access control, as well as the ability to synchronize user data across devices.

🔹	AWS Amplify - a set of tools and services that enables mobile and web app developers to build scalable full stack serverless applications. 

🔹	AWS DynamoDB - a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It allows to store and retrieve any amount of data.

🔹	GraphQL - provides a flexible and powerful way for clients to request exactly the data they need from an API. With GraphQL, the client defines the structure of the data it needs, and the server responds with only the requested data.

🔹	Drag and Drop - Drag'n'Drop backend compatible with React DnD. The application can smoothly use the nice HTML5 compatible backend and fallback on the Touch one on mobile devices!
